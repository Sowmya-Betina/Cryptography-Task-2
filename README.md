Cryptography and Applications assignment Task 2

Cryptographic Implementation - Alogorithm AES 
AES GCM mode 
Mechanisms are included to protect integrity, confidentiality and Authenticity
Use of RSA asymmetric encryption anddigital signatures
Key management practice - key values are disclosed in output and Hash fingerprint, Digital Signature is verified

The code combines the speed of symmetric encryption (AES) with the security of asymmetric encryption (RSA) and ensures data integrity and authenticity via digital signatures.
